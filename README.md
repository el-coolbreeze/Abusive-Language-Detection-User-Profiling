# Abusive-Language-Detection-User-Profiling
Evaluation of several Machine learning &amp; deep learning algorithms for tweet classification
this project uses a user profiling algorithm that relies on a deep learning algorithm known as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
trained to detect abusive language using word embedding features learned from the training set to
classify user tweets in our categories of interest into five different categories of abusive language.
the user profiling has not being added to this repository as this is an ongoing thesis work and will be made available
later or on request.

Python programming language and its machine learning libraries were used for the implementation.
